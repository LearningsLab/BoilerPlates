## Common Design Pattern Use Cases

### Adapter Design Pattern
- It combines the two incompatible interfaces/components so that client or other code changes can be avoided

### Builder Design Pattern
- When we have multiple attributes which can just explode the no of constructors of that class. Using Builder Pattern we can just create the immutable object.

### Factory Design Pattern
- when we need to create different types of objects in the application. Factory pattern helps in organising the code

### Fly Weight Design Pattern

### Singleton Design Pattern
- when we just need to have single object of the class thoughtout the application
 
### Decorator Design Pattern

### Strategy Design Pattern

### Prototype Design Pattern

### Proxy Design Pattern
